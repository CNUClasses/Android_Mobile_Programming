              <strong>In order to compile your project I will;</strong>
              <ol>
              <li>Unzip it</li>
              <li>In Android Studio I will choose File->New->Import Project and then select your settings.gradle file.  (This will rebuild iml and idea files that work on my install of Android Studio)</li>
              </ol>
             For most projects you should:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Check Permissions, especially in terms of gradle settings and test targets, you want the latest SDKs ? Then please implement runtime permissions</li>
                    <li>Perform error checks! Do not dereference null objects.</li>
                    <li>Test on a clean install!</li>
                    <li>Use preference change listeners rather than fetch the pref whenever its needed</li>

                   Open this page on your device, then click on the link to the left to install on your physical or emulated device(You will probably have to allow installs from Google Drive).  
                   The install will give you security warnings since I generated the apk with an unrecognized key. Install anyway.  Then run the application to see what you have to do.<br>
                     You will need to create an Andoid Studio project (use 'Empty Activity' project template) in order to create your application that mirrors mine.
