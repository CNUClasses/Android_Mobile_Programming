              <ol>
              <li>Unzip it</li>
              <li>In Android Studio I will choose File->New->Import Project and then select your settings.gradle file.  (This will rebuild iml and idea files that work on my install of Android Studio)</li>
              </ol>
             For most projects you should:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Check Permissions, especially in terms of gradle settings and test targets, you want the latest SDKs ? Then please implement runtime permissions</li>
                    <li>Perform error checks! Do not dereference null objects.</li>
                    <li>Test on a clean install!</li>
                    <li>Use preference change listeners rather than fetch the pref whenever its needed</li>
